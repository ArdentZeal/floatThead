Demos were moved into my github hosted site. To grab them do this:

git clone git@github.com:mkoryak/mkoryak.github.com.git
cd mkoryak.github.com/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open http://localhost:8000/floatThead

If you don't have python, open index.htm but it wont work well in chrome because chrome likes real servers.
